# Background
ðŸŒ  The job market dataset includes various attributes such as job titles, companies, locations, salaries, and job descriptions. The primary objective is to use SQL to clean, process, and analyze this data to understand job trends and salary distributions.

# Tools I Used
-  **SQL**: For querying and analyzing data.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the database management system.
- **GIT and GITHUB**: For upload and create a repositor.
- **Excel**: For initial data exploration and preprocessing.
   
    
    
# The Analysis
The project_sql directory contains the following SQL scripts:

### 1_top_paying_jobs.sql: Identifies the top-paying jobs.

This script reveals which job titles offer the highest average salaries. For example, "Staff Data Scientist/Quant Researcher" and "Staff Data Scientist - Business Analytics" at Selby Jennings offer the highest average annual salaries, indicating that specialized data science roles in quantitative research and business analytics are highly lucrative.


```sql
SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM  job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here the breakdown of the top data scientists jobs in 2023:

- **Specialization Matters** - Roles like "Staff Data Scientist/Quant Researcher" and "Head of Battery Data Science" indicate a focus on specific domains or industries. This specialization often commands higher salaries due to the expertise required and the value they bring to the organization.

- **Leadership Positions** - Roles such as "Head of Data Science" and "Director Level - Product Management - Data Science" show that leadership positions in data science can lead to higher compensation. These roles often involve not just technical skills but also strategic decision-making and team management responsibilities.

- **Company Size and Reputation** - Companies like Walmart, Reddit, and Demandbase are well-known and likely have substantial resources to invest in data science. Positions in such companies may offer higher salaries compared to smaller or less established companies.

### 2_top_paying_job_skills.sql: Analyzes skills associated with top-paying jobs.

 By identifying skills linked to the highest-paying jobs, this analysis helps professionals focus on acquiring the most financially rewarding skills. Skills relevant to high-paying roles such as those at Selby Jennings and Algo Capital Group are particularly valuable.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS(
SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM  job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
```

Here the breakdown of the top data scientists job skills in 2023:

- **Proficiency in Programming Languages** - There is a strong demand for skills in languages such as SQL, Python, Java, and others like Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn. This suggests that employers value candidates capable of efficiently manipulating and analyzing data in an automated manner.

- **Competencies in Platforms and Tools** - In addition to programming languages, skills in cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and GCP are also highly valued. This reflects the increasing adoption of cloud infrastructure for processing and analyzing data at scale.

- **Specialization in Specific Domains** - Some positions require specific knowledge, such as the Director of Data Science with skills in Pandas and Numpy, indicating a need for professionals specialized in data analysis within a particular context, such as data science applied to specific products or services. This highlights the importance of specialization in certain domains for more advanced and well-paying positions.

### 3_top_demanded_skills.sql: Finds the most demanded skills in the job market.

 This analysis highlights which skills are in the highest demand, guiding job seekers to develop these skills. For instance, skills in data science and analytics are highly demanded across various roles.



``` sql
SELECT skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
    job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5
```

Here the breakdown of the top demanded skills for data scientists in 2023:


- **Python Dominance**: Python stands out as the most in-demand skill for data scientists, with a significantly higher demand count compared to other skills. Its versatility, ease of use, and extensive libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and visualization contribute to its popularity.

- **SQL Proficiency**: SQL (Structured Query Language) remains a crucial skill for data scientists, with a substantial demand count. Proficiency in SQL is essential for managing and querying databases, which are often a primary source of data for data science projects.

- **Emerging Technologies**: Skills like AWS (Amazon Web Services) indicate a growing demand for cloud computing expertise among data scientists. As more organizations adopt cloud-based solutions for data storage, processing, and deployment, familiarity with platforms like AWS becomes increasingly valuable for data scientists.

These insights highlight the importance of a diverse skill set for data scientists, encompassing programming languages, data querying and manipulation, and knowledge of emerging technologies like cloud computing.
