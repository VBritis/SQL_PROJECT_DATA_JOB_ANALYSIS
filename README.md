# Background
ðŸŒ  The job market dataset includes various attributes such as job titles, companies, locations, salaries, and job descriptions. The primary objective is to use SQL to clean, process, and analyze this data to understand job trends and salary distributions.

# Tools I Used
-  **SQL**: For querying and analyzing data.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the database management system.
- **GIT and GITHUB**: For upload and create a repositor.
- **Python with Pandas and Matplotlib**: 
**Pandas**: This is essential for data manipulation and analysis, especially for handling large datasets, cleaning, and transforming data.
**Matplotlib**: Ideal for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It will help you create detailed charts and graphs to better present your analysis.
   
    
    
# The Analysis
The project_sql directory contains the following SQL scripts:

### 1_top_paying_jobs.sql: Identifies the top-paying jobs.

This script reveals which job titles offer the highest average salaries. For example, "Staff Data Scientist/Quant Researcher" and "Staff Data Scientist - Business Analytics" at Selby Jennings offer the highest average annual salaries, indicating that specialized data science roles in quantitative research and business analytics are highly lucrative.


```sql
SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM  job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here the breakdown of the top data scientists jobs in 2023:

- **Specialization Matters** - Roles like "Staff Data Scientist/Quant Researcher" and "Head of Battery Data Science" indicate a focus on specific domains or industries. This specialization often commands higher salaries due to the expertise required and the value they bring to the organization.

### 5_optimal_skills.sql: Determines the optimal skills that balance demand and pay.

 This analysis identifies skills that are both highly demanded and well-compensated, providing a strategic focus for career development. Skills relevant to roles such as "Director of Data Science & Analytics" at Reddit and "Head of Data Science" at Demandbase are both in demand and well-paid.




```sql
WITH skills_demand AS(
    SELECT
        skills_dim.skill_id, 
        skills_dim.skills,
        COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
    FROM job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
        job_work_from_home = TRUE AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
    GROUP BY
        skills_dim.skill_id
), avg_salary_skills AS(
    SELECT
        skills_job_dim.skill_id, 
        ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg),0) AS avg_salary
    FROM job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
        job_work_from_home = TRUE
    GROUP BY
        skills_job_dim.skill_id
)

SELECT
    skills_demand.skill_id,
    skills_demand.skills,
    demand_count,
    avg_salary
FROM 
    skills_demand
INNER JOIN avg_salary_skills ON skills_demand.skill_id = avg_salary_skills.skill_id
ORDER BY
     avg_salary DESC,
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 25
```


- **High Salary Doesn't Always Correlate with High Demand**:
Skills like GDPR and Golang are among the highest paying with average salaries of $217,738 and $208,750 respectively, but their demand counts are relatively low, with GDPR at 4 and Golang at 2. This suggests that while these skills are highly valued monetarily, they are not as widely required in the job market.

- **Broadly Required Skills with Moderate Salaries**:
Skills such as "C" and "Go" have high demand counts of 48 and 57 respectively, with average salaries of $164,865 and $164,691. This indicates that these skills are broadly required across various job roles, even though they do not command the highest salaries. Employers may be willing to pay moderately high salaries due to the widespread necessity of these skills.

- **Niche Skills with High Salaries**:
Several niche skills, such as "Atlassian" and "Microstrategy", have moderate demand counts (5 and 6 respectively) but command relatively high average salaries ($189,700 and $171,147). This indicates that while these skills are not in high demand, they are specialized enough to warrant higher pay when they are needed.
